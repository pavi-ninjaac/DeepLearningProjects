# DeepLearningProjects
## Stated this repository in the goal of learning image classification, object detection etc.

### First Step - Learning How to load and show a image?
you can take a look at this file to see 5 different ways to load and show the image in python and deep learing.( 5 Diffrent ways to handle image )[https://github.com/pavi-ninjaac/DeepLearningProjects/blob/main/FiveWays_of_image_read_display.ipynb] <br>

### Second step - Image Classification using Pretrained models.
 The Model I used here is MobileNet. Which is from google 2017, which has 3 versions <br>
 1st version(2017),version 2(2018) , version 3(2019). Normally version1 and version2 is in use.<br>
